"""This module allows easy use of readline completion function and
easy input.

First, import the necessary names::

    >>> from console_io import ConsoleCompleter, read_line

To use completion, first set up a ``ConsoleCompleter`` with a list of
completions::

    >>> compl = ConsoleCompleter(['milk', 'eggs', 'cheese', 'chicken'])

Now use ``read_line()`` to read input::

    >>> item = read_line('Enter an item: ')

On the console, completion will occur on the typed text when <Tab> is
pressed::

    Enter an item: m<Tab>
    Enter an item: milk

Text with multiple completions will show below the prompt when <Tab>
is pressed twice::

    Enter an item: c<Tab><Tab>
    cheese chicken
    Enter an item: ch<Tab>
    Enter an item: chicken
